A fully functional 2D RPG game engine developed 99% solo using pure Java (AWT) without third-party libraries or game engines.

The system was architected from scratch with a modular, object-oriented approach, allowing for future extensibility and reusability. All core systemsâ€”game loop, rendering, enemy AI, item drops, player skills, data-driven level design, quest & dialogue systemsâ€”were implemented by hand with a strong focus on clarity, separation of concerns, and performance.

Although UI is minimal, the project emphasizes robust gameplay logic, maintainable architecture, and dynamic content loading.

ðŸ”’ This game was designed and implemented almost entirely by me (Ton Minh) as a solo project. All logic, architecture, and systems were built from scratch in pure Java.

ðŸ”§ Forked from team repo. This fork represents my individual development of the project, covering 99% of the implementation. (Ton Minh)
