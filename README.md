# Notes

A fully functional 2D RPG game engine developed 99% solo using pure Java (AWT) without third-party libraries or game engines.

The system was architected from scratch with a modular, object-oriented approach, allowing for future extensibility and reusability. All core systems—game loop, rendering, enemy AI, item drops, player skills, data-driven level design, quest & dialogue systems—were implemented by hand with a strong focus on clarity, separation of concerns, and performance.

Although UI is minimal, the project emphasizes robust gameplay logic, maintainable architecture, and dynamic content loading.

🔒 This game was designed and implemented almost entirely by me (Ton Minh) as a solo project. All logic, architecture, and systems were built from scratch in pure Java.

🔧 Forked from team repo. This fork represents my individual development of the project, covering 99% of the implementation. (Ton Minh)

# 🩸 BleedGame – 2D Java Action RPG (No Engine)

**BleedGame** is a self-built 2D RPG framework coded from scratch in pure Java, featuring a custom game loop, modular systems, and data-driven world design. This solo project showcases game architecture, gameplay logic, and scalable system design without using any third-party engines or libraries.

## 🔥 Highlights

- ⚙️ Frame-based Game Loop (delta time)
- 🧭 Data-Driven Level System (tilemap, enemies, quests, traps, dialogues…)
- ⚔️ Custom Physics & Collision Detection
- 🧠 Enemy AI (melee, ranged, boss) + Loot Behavior
- 💥 Visual Effects (fireballs, death fades, trap triggers)
- 🧪 Status Effects (e.g., bleed from traps)
- 🧃 Potion Shop + Inventory System
- 🔄 Skill & Cooldown System (player & enemy)
- 🎮 Player Mechanics: Movement, Jump, Double Jump, Wall Slide
- 🗺️ Minimap, Dialogue, NPC Interaction
- 🧱 Object System: touchable, untouchable, background
- 🔊 Audio Settings Menu
- 🧩 Scalable, maintainable architecture
